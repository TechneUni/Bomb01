Bomb source code for CS100.01: A Beginner Programming Tutorial That Doesn't
Suck.

**BEGIN TRANSMISSION**

This is operative A███ communicating from TUD-MCU. Messaging all security
clearance ￼-level or higher operatives for immediate support. Please resp�nd as
soon as possible.

Our developers are swam�ed. As of M��ch 6�h, 20██, the red-hat hacking group
self-identi�ied as **The Algorithm** has successfully infiltrated and encrypted
the vast majority of o█r data. We are currently working on circ██vention
measures, but unfortunately, it seems we may not meet the time requirement for
data dest█uction.

It seems a variety of bombs have been placed at cri██cal areas of varying
complexity. Luckily, some enc█yption measures are relatively weak. Other
loca��ons are not as lucky.

Plain an� simply, we require y██r immediate assistance.

Attached is a test ha�ness for the b█mb to the m██n control unit's global
processor lock system. Effectively, all processors' tr██t modules for█security
measures have been shut down and a██ encrypted by a series of ��mplicated
mathe█atical equations. As such, no data-critical computers are im�ediately
accessible.

The test harness is n█t directly attached to the bomb, so trial-and-error
approaches are e█couraged. Your solutions to these problems can be tested and
implemented directly on the bomb at T█D.

You can run the test harness with `python main.py`. It will indicate which locks
have successfully been circumvented. Write your solut█ons within the functions
provided in `bombs/critical.py` and `bombs/auxiliary.py`. All critical locks are
required to succes█fully defuse a bomb; Auxili�ry locks are attached to si��lar
modules. Bypassing these locks represents significant potential gain in other
systems. Information is provided on a per-lock basis in the code files.

Help us recl�im our intellectual property and free us from the cyber-thre�t we
are currently under. You are our only hope.
