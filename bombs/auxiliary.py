    AFFECTED MODULE: Water bottle station

    They took out our water bottle station! Now we have to fill our bottles from
    the fountain. They played us for fools.

    The water bottle station is an advanced piece of machinery imported from
    overseas. As far as I understand, it computes a quadratic regression based
    on the momentum of the water particles, flow rate, and the scanned bottle
    position in order to accurately shoot a stream of silky smooth water into
    our flasks.

    This regression module is currently broken and is returning zero values. It
    SHOULD return the values computed by the quadratic equation (the two roots
    to indicate where water leaves the nozzle and enters the bottle). Can you
    compute and return these values?

    The quadratic equation's two roots are given by the formula:
    xPos = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
    xNeg = (-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

    The boss disabled the air conditioning ventilation checker due to cost
    cutting measures. Something about workplace satisfaction being a luxury for
    developers... Who knows. Anyways, there's a bomb on it now and the module is
    broken.

    The air conditioning automatically turns on when the temperature exceeds 75
    degrees Fahrenheit. However, the sensor input for temperature is in degrees
    Kelvin (K), due to foreign imported parts.

    Return True when the temperature exceeds 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Give us air
    conditioning, or give us death.

    AFFECTED MODULE: Main Control Unit Coffee Maker

    The MCU coffee maker is a critical module that controls the coffee maker's
    operation. Without it, the coffee maker will not function, severely impeding
    the development team's ability to function.

    This module is a critical requirement. It is of utmost importance.

    The coffee maker takes in a variety of parameters:
    - groundsMass: The mass of coffee grounds (in grams).
    - waterHeat: The temperature of the water (in degrees Celsius).
    - cupPlaced: A boolean value indicating if a cup is placed.

    The coffee maker Go flag returns a high value when all conditions are met:
    - The mass of coffee grounds is greater than 0.25 lbs.
    - The water temperature is greater than 102 degrees Fahrenheit.
    - A cup is placed.

    The coffee maker is currently broken, and has been a high ticket item on the
    team's development backlog. Fix the coffee maker go flag.
