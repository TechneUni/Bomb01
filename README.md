# Bomb 01: Basics

Bomb source code for CS100.01: A Beginner Programming Tutorial That Doesn't
Suck.

Unit)

`Decryption partially successful. Some critical data may be lost.`

**BEGIN TRANSMISSION**

This is operative A███ communicating from TUD-MCU. Messaging all security
clearance ￼-level or higher operatives for immediate support. Please respond as
soon as possible.

Our developers are swamped. As of March 6th, 2024, the red-hat hacking group
self-identified as **The Algorithm** has successfully infiltrated and encrypted
the vast majority of our data. We are currently working on circumvention
measures, but unfortunately, it seems we may not meet the time requirement for
data destruction.

It seems a variety of bombs have been placed at critical areas of varying
complexity. Luckily, some encryption measures are relatively weak. Other
locations are not as lucky.

Plain and simply, we require your immediate assistance.

Attached is a test harness for the bomb to the main control unit's global
processor lock system. Effectively, all processors' trust modules for security
measures have been shut down and are encrypted by a series of complicated
mathematical equations. As such, no data-critical computers are immediately
accessible.

The test harness is not directly attached to the bomb, so trial-and-error
approaches are encouraged. Your solutions to these problems can be tested and
implemented directly on the bomb at TUD.

You can run the test harness with `python main.py`. It will indicate which locks
have successfully been circumvented. Write your solutions within the functions
provided in `bombs/critical.py` and `bombs/auxiliary.py`. All critical locks are
required to successfully defuse a bomb; Auxiliary locks are attached to similar
modules. Bypassing these locks represents significant potential gain in other
systems. Information is provided on a per-lock basis in the code files.

Help us reclaim our intellectual property and free us from the cyber-threat we
are currently under. You are our only hope.
